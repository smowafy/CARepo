# CARepo

The	goal	of	this	project	is	to	implement	a	low-level cycle-accurate	
pipelined	MIPS	datapath	simulator.	Simulating	the	datapath	includes	simulating	all	of	its
storage	components	(register	file,	memories, and	pipeline	registers)	and	all	of	its	control	
signals. This	document	details	the	supported	instructions,	the	inputs	to	the	simulator,	and	
the	expected	outputs.

The project consists of six parts:

1- Parser ~ Mayar Bassel
2- Fetcher ~ Hossam Hany
3- Decoder ~ Sherif Mowafy
4- Executer ~ Aya Amr - Menna Darwish
5- Memory ~ Menna Darwish - Aya Amr
6- WriteBack ~ Omar Wanis
